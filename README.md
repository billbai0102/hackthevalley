# Hack The Valley 4

## Introduction
Nowadays, as the amount of repairman scam is growing, it is extremely hard to find some quality and honest technicians that are reasonably priced. Whether people are looking for a car mechanic or a home repair handyman, many people have experienced overpriced and low-quality services. We see that different decentralized platforms made peopleâ€™s lives convenient so we believe that this would be a good idea to approach. We want people to not stress about getting scam when finding technicians so we decided to build a platform about it.

## How WorkBounce work
Our website facilitates searching for all kinds of technicians in a reliable way. We allow both searchers and technicians to review each others after every job so that users and technicians can see what to expect in the job and decide whether to continue with the appointments. The website calculates the average ratings for each service provider as well as the average rating of everyone to provide a correct rating scale.
